          <h2>life size Rem figure</h2>
          <p>
            The $40,000 asking price includes shipping and insurance costs, as
            well as duty and taxes, so you have that covered, at least. The
            reason you need to act fast is because only three figures have been
            manufactured. Life-size Rem stands at around 158 cm tall and weighs
            57 kg. Add in the parasol, though, and the total height extends to
            206 cm.
