            <h1>Life size Rem figure</h1>
            <p>
              The $40,000 asking price includes shipping and insurance costs, as
              well as duty and taxes, so you have that covered, at least. The
              reason you need to act fast is because only three figures have
              been manufactured, That's the only place these three are shipping,
              and just in case your pockets are feeling doubly deep, this
              made-to-order item is limited to one per customer.
            </p>

            <p>
              life-size Rem stands at around 158 cm tall and weighs 57 kg. Add
              in the parasol, though, and the total height extends to 206 cm.
